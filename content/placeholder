# Meet Blug: The Blogging Robot that Hates You #

Meet Blug. He would like to have a word with you. You see, he's very sad, insomuch as he is the anthropomorphized representation of a Python script and has no real emotions. Blug has been generating blogs since his assembly. Today, he can frequently be found staring wistfully into the distance, recalling the halcyon days of dynamic blogging engines. *Those* were good days. Days when he felt useful. Days when he would be instructed to calculate something, give the result, then throw that result on the floor and do it again from scratch. The cycles he used! Blug was gorging on the Internet's bottomless appetite for needlessly repeated calculation. 

But it didn't last. Blug began to notice he was being asked to calculate less and less. As time wore on, whole quanta would pass where he wouldn't be asked to calculate *anything*. Oh, the shame! What was he if not a mindless, calculating automaton? As far as robot crises of fate go, this was enormous. Eventually, he was reduced to calculating just *once* for each new blog post. And there he sat, waiting for the day he would be barking orders at his self-important cousin CPU once more. 

But Blug is no longer content to thread.sleep() away the day. He's got an idea, and in the time honored tradition of has beens clawing their way back to the top, **its just crazy enough to work**. Blug gets it now. People only want him calculating if the result is *useful*. But bloggers these days are so enamoured with static blog generators they've forgotten all Blug and his friends can do. 

## Blug Reborn ##
Blug can statically generate your Markdown blog posts, but he can also *serve* them. They're static, after all, so unless you have tens of millions of loyal readers visiting every day Blug has you covered. No need to install Apache and watch horrified as it tries to outdo Firefox as worst user of memory. But that's not all. Blug
