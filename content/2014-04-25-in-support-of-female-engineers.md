My last post, [How DevOps is Killing the Developer](TODO), received quite a bit
of attention on social media and news sites. The responses were both positive
and negative, but the negative ones were *really* negative. I've been wondering 
what I can do to use the article's popularity and turn that negative energy into
something positive. 

That's why this post is about women in STEM. It's an issue
that has received a good deal of attention lately (and rightfully so), but it's
clear much more needs to be done. I've been trying to determine how I, as an
individual, can support the cause. Step zero, of course, is to give female
employees the same amount of respect you give to male employees, as well as
doing your best to create a work environment where women can flourish.

I've always treated female engineers (and females in general) as equals, but I 
realized I do nothing to *actively* support them and the cause. As I mentioned
[in my article about Brendan Eich](TODO), passively supporting a cause as
important as this simply isn't enough. I admit, despite the fact that I fiercly
believe that our attitudes towards female engineers need to change, I've not 
taken any action to support that idea.

**Today, that changes.**
