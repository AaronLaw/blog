title: Anatomy of an eBook Launch: Raw Numbers

On January 24th, I officially "launched" my eBook [Writing Idiomatic Python](www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook). I had no idea what to expect and even less of an idea about what I should do to promote it. So I did the easiest thing: posted to reddit ([/r/python](http://www.reddit.com/r/python/) to be specific). Aside from a [post to hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5112211) not about the book itself and a single tweet, posting on reddit was the only thing I did.

**And that was enough.**

The post got a few upvotes and stayed on the front page of /r/python for 5 days
(and was the top post for about 2 days). The traffic, from reddit alone mind
you, sold a lot of books (the exact numbers are discussed later).

## Some Raw Numbers

Between the 24th and 29th, I received 10,002 pageviews during 6,052 visits from
4,848 visitors. As you can see below, the majority of these came during the first two days (1,570
visits on the 24th and 1,896 on the 25th).

## Missteps

When I started, I only offered PDF versions of the book ($8.99) with payment via credit
card. Much of the early feedback fell in to one of three categories:

* I want to buy the book but can't pay via credit card. Can you enable payments
    via (PayPal, GoogleCheckout, etc)
* I want to read the book on my mobile device. Can you offer the book in the
    **epub** format?
* I want to buy both versions of the book, but $18 is more than I'm willing to
    spend.

Needless to say I got right to work. By Friday morning I set up PayPal and
Google Checkout as payment options. A few hours later, I offered a bundle of all
versions and all formats of the book for $12.99 (roughly 50% more than the cost
of the book in a single version/format.) Both of these helped, but one had a
considerably larger impact.

**The 'bundle' option quickly became the most popular. I was now making 50% more per sale.**

I had effectively increased the price of the most commonly purchased item from $8.99 to $12.99.
Aparrently, either a lot of people wanted the contents of the bundle or, more
likely, the bundle's price was very attractive compared to a single version.

 [book](www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook), I'm happy to send out
free copies of the book to those without the financial means to purchase it.
