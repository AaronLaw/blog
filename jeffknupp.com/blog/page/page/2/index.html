  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things I wish I had known when starting my Django project for
<a href="http://www.illestrhyme.com">IllestRhyme</a> was &#8220;How do I start a <em>real</em>
Django project&#8221;. As in, one that&#8217;s actually going to be used and
developed more, not the toy project from the (admittedly execellent)
Django documentation.</p>

<p>Having just gone through this process again for my new site, I wanted to
share the knowledge I&#8217;ve gained about how to properly start a project in
Django. By the end of this post, you will have</p>

<pre><code>1. A fully functional Django project
2. All resources under source control (with git)
3. An environment independet install of your project (using virtualenv)
4. Automated deployment and testing (using Fabric)
5. Automatic database migrations (using South)
6. A solid start to your new site
</code></pre>

<p>None of these steps, except for perhaps the first, are covered in the
official tutorial. They should be. If you&#8217;re looking to start a new,
production ready Django project, look no further.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started work on my second Django powered site today. It&#8217;s not
ready to be unveiled, but I&#8217;ve realized that, while your first site will
always be your baby, your second is where you start to hit your stride.</p>

<p>So what have I done differently? For one, <strong>testing</strong>. For
<a href="http://www.illestrhyme.com">IllestRhyme</a> I never wrote any tests, which
has caused me no end of troubles. Now that the site is stable and
actively used, it&#8217;s difficult to make myself go back and write tests,
though I know I need to. The new site has unit tests for
everything, and though it&#8217;s somewhat of a pain to do, it will most
certainly pay dividends in the long run.</p>

<p>In the production environment, everything is running
under <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>, Python&#8217;s unofficial answer to the problem of running multiple
Python environments. It effectively does a clean Python install to a local
directory and hijacks <code>pip</code> and <code>easy_install</code> commands to install
packages locally. This guarantees packages for the new site don&#8217;t clash
with packages for the old site.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.fabfile.org">Fabric</a> for automating deployment tasks. While before I relied on a set of git hooks, this became a bit cumbersome. Fabric is fantastic for deployment. My fabfile backs up the site, downloads packages from git, creates symlinks, run South migrations, runs the tests, and reloads Apache. Deployment should really be a one-button-press activity. Fabric makes it easy. Thanks to a number of commenters (Alexis Bellido on this site, joelhaasnoot, spleeyah, jsvaughan, and marcofucci on Hacker News)  for pointing this out on a previous post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the first in a series of posts I plan to do over the next month about Analytics and Django. In this post I&#8217;ll walk through how I began to use a number of analytics tools to
drive decisions about my site, <a href="http://www.illestrhyme.com">IllestRhyme</a>.</p>

<p>One of the first things I did when writing
<a href="http://www.illestrhyme.com">IllestRhyme</a> was to sign up for Google
Analytics. I had never run a web site before, but I was aware of
Google&#8217;s analytics offering. I admit, for the first few weeks after the
site went live I would start at the Google Analytics page and <strong>hope</strong> to
see users in the Live View. I wasn&#8217;t really using the data for anything.
I was using Google Analytics as a virtual scoreboard.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I signed up for <a href="http://getclicky.com/66528953">Clicky</a>
that I started to take analytics seriously. In fact, more specifically,
it was when I combined Clicky and
<a href="https://github.com/jcassee/django-analytical">django-analytical</a> that I
really took my first deep-dive into using analytical data for decision
making. Since django-analytical already integrates with a number of
analytics services, including Clicky, setup was a breeze. Sure, I could
have inserted the raw code into my Django templates, but
django-analytical gave me a single point at which to configure all my
analytics services.</p>

<p>More importantly, and I can not stress this enough,
<strong>django-analytical&#8217;s Clicky integration let me see my users in Clicky via
their contrib.auth usernames</strong>. This was <strong>huge</strong>. Now, instead of
staring at IP addresses, I could follow users on their visit to the site (using
<a href="http://getclicky.com/66528953">Clicky&#8217;s</a> awesome Spy feature) in
real-time by username. Believe me, nothing will teach you more about you
users than recognizing usernames and their associated behavior patterns.
I could tell which users were hitting the site to check quickly for
updates, which users hung around for a while, and which users <em>used the
site like it was crack</em>. It was this last group that I was initially
interested in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At my real job I&#8217;ve been working in my spare time on a large-scale Python testing framework. When I decided our current framework didn&#8217;t meet our needs, I took a new approach (for me) to developing software: <em>coding backwards</em>. Since doing so, I&#8217;ve learned that coding backwards can, <em>but not will</em>, lead to the creation of some fabulous APIs.</p>

<p>The idea for coding backwards was most clearly verbalized for me by
Aaron Swartz and his <a href="http://webpy.org">web.py</a> framework. He says:</p>

<blockquote><p>I wrote a web application in Python just imagining how I wanted the API<br/> to be. It started with import web, of course, and then had a place to<br/> define URLs, simple functions for GET and POST, a thing to deal with<br/> input variables and so on. Once the code looked right to me, I did<br/> whatever it took to make it execute without changing the application<br/> code &#8211; the result was web.py.</p></blockquote>


<p>This was a revelation for me. When you&#8217;re building software for others
to use, <strong>make it as natural as possible for them to do so</strong>. I call
this <em>coding backwards</em>. It directly influenced how I built my testing
framework.</p>

<p>I started with the finished product: a test script written in Python. I
wrote valid Python code against a library that didn&#8217;t exist yet. Without
an existing API to get in my way, I was able to express my intentions
clearly. Anyone reading the test script would immediately know what was
happening. More importantly, they wouldn&#8217;t be exposed to weird
implementation quirks. It was my version of the &#8220;optimal&#8221; test script for our system in Python.
After writing that script, there was only one problem: it didn&#8217;t
actually do anything yet.</p>

<p>From the test script, I created the classes and functions that the test
script called. What I did within the library was less important than
<em>not changing the test script to fit the library</em>. If I have to make a
few weird implementation decisions as a result, fine. The point is,
<strong>users are going to use the library&#8217;s API, not the library&#8217;s
internals</strong>. Of course, that doesn&#8217;t mean the implementation can be
spaghetti coded crap. It must be implemented professionally, just with
making the test script work as expected the primary goal.</p>

<p>Coding backwards prevents you from writing functionality that no one
will use, because someone is already using all of your library. That
keeps the interfaces tight and well defined. With something like a
testing framework, the interface is king. The ratio of test case writers
to test framework maintainers will be something like 10:1, so creating a
friendly, usable interface is key.</p>

<p>In actually writing the implementation, I found myself bouncing around
between the top level interface code and the lowest level library code
quite a bit. I would create a top level class or function, realize it
would need to call some library code, then go off and write that library
code. Again, though, I was coding backwards. I didn&#8217;t start off writing
a bunch of low level libraries I thought I would need. I deferred
creation of the libraries until I actually needed them.</p>

<p>This lends itself well to writing tests. At each point, you&#8217;re writing
the minimum required to get the interface working. Sounds suspiciously
like the methodology for creating unit tests. In practice, writing tests
naturally fit into the development flow. This is most decidedly <em>a good
thing</em>.</p>

<p>While the framework isn&#8217;t complete, it certainly is usable. What&#8217;s more,
it usable by just about anyone without having to even look at the
interface. Since I created the test script first, I have a wonderful
example to show the library&#8217;s canonical use. I&#8217;ve been quite happy with
the results of coding the framework backwards. It puts emphasis on the
interface rather than the implementation, which is exactly where the
emphasis should be in a testing framework.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started <a href="http://www.illestrhyme.com">IllestRhyme</a>, I had never used git . Git gives me distributed version
control and the ease (and speed!) of the git workflow for a slight learning
curve. Below is how I set up my Django project to use git, from start to
finish.</p>

<p>To begin, I had my Django project already created and a bit of code in
there, so I needed to &#8220;add&#8221; it to a new git repo. All that&#8217;s needed for
this is to <code>cd</code> into the top level directory and run <code>git init .</code> This
sets up a git repo in the directory, <strong>but doesn&#8217;t commit the files.</strong>
Before committing, we&#8217;ll want to setup our <code>.gitignore</code> file to tell
git what files not to track in version control. Since I&#8217;m working with Python files using
vim, my <code>.gitignore</code> file has the following contents:</p>

<pre><code>*.pyc
*.swp
local_settings.py
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>local_settings.py</code> file is part of my development workflow, as
explained in <a href="http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/02/05/django-production-deployment-using-git/">this post</a>. After we create
the <code>.gitignore</code> file, we add <em>everything</em> to the repository, using <code>git
add .</code> This stages all of our files for commit to git. At this point, we
can run <code>git commit</code> to actually commit our files for the first time.</p>

<p>At this point, we have our Django project in a (local) git repository. I
use Bitbucket as a &#8220;backup&#8221; git repo in case I lose my web server. As
you might have guessed, I do all my work on the web server directly
using ssh, gvim, and X tunneling. This is not necessarily recommended
for large projects, but it works well for a single developer. Whenever I
make a change and commit it, I use <code>git push</code> to push the commit to
Bitbucket, so that Bitbucket always has the latest copy of the repo.</p>

<p>Once we&#8217;ve committed to git, the first thing to do is clone our
repository to create a development environment in a new area on our
machine reserved for development. If you&#8217;re cloning on the
same machine, you&#8217;ll use <code>git clone &lt;path/to/original/git/repo&gt;</code>. Github
or Bitbucket users will use <code>git clone &lt;remote repository&gt;</code>, where
&#8221;<remote repository>&#8221; is what the service shows is the URL for your repo. Regardless,
clone your repo to create a dev environment that exactly mirrors your
prod environment.</p>

<p>In our new development area, we&#8217;ll first want to create a
branch, using <code>git branch &lt;branchname&gt;</code>. Git creates a branch of the
current branch (which for us will have been &#8216;master&#8217;). <strong>It does not,
however, switch you to that branch.</strong> To switch to working on your new
branch, use <code>git checkout &lt;branchname&gt;</code>. To see what branches are
available, just type <code>git branch</code>. The branch you are currently on will
be marked with a &#8216;*&#8217;.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve done some work on your branch that you&#8217;re happy with, it&#8217;s
time to commit. If you added files during this phase, run <code>git add
&lt;filenames&gt;</code> to stage them to be committed. Alternately, you can use
<code>git add .</code> to add <em>all</em> untracked files to be committed. From here,
just commit using <code>git commit &lt;changedfiles&gt;</code> or <code>git commit -a</code> for all
changed files that git is tracking.</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s time to merge your changes back into your master branch. Switch
back to the master branch with <code>git checkout master</code> and merge the
changes with <code>git merge &lt;branchname&gt;</code>. If there are no conflicts, <em>git
will autocommit the merge changes</em> and nothing more needs to be done. If
conflicts do arise, manually fix them and <code>git commit</code> them. Git will
prepopulate the commit message with something like &#8216;Merge from
<branchname>&#8217;, which you can replace or, better yet, enhance.</p>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got our changes committed to the master branch in our
development area, it&#8217;s time to push them to production. If you&#8217;re using
a service like Github or Bitbucket, first push the changes there with a
<code>git push</code>. Next, <code>cd</code> into your production area and pull down the
changes using <code>git pull</code> (or <code>git pull &lt;development repo area&gt;</code> for a
repo on the local machine). This should update the master branch in your
production area with all of the changes committed from development.
That&#8217;s it! You&#8217;ve successfully used git to manage changes in a Django
project!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m certainly no git guru and there are likely aspects of this workflow
that can be enhanced or simplified. If you see something that doesn&#8217;t
make sense or can be streamlined, please let me know in the comments.
I&#8217;m always looking to improve my git-Fu!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I wrote my last post, which hit the frontpage of HackerNews, I
wanted to see what the HNers would see. So I cleared my cookies, logged
out, and navigated over to <a href="http://www.illestrhyme.com">IllestRhyme</a>.
When I got there, something caught my eye:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.illestrhyme.com:8080/images/chat.jpg"></p>

<p>It&#8217;s normal for me to be talking to users, and normal for me to be
responding to requests from users. <strong>If this isn&#8217;t normal for you, it should be</strong>.
Part of the reason IllestRhyme has a community feel is that the users
get the sense that their requests don&#8217;t go off into the ether. I&#8217;m
hanging around, reading their emails, forum posts, and chat transcripts.
If they suggest something, I almost always implement it. What&#8217;s more,
they are rewarded for their suggestion through Rep points, which tracks
reputation on the site.</p>

<p>I love the size of the site as it is right now. Sure, I want the number
of users to explode, but with about 150 users, I know all of them, talk
to them frequently, and have a general idea of the type of user they are
(power, casual, etc).</p>

<p><strong>The number of users on the site may go up, but my interaction with them
won&#8217;t end.</strong> My first hire would ideally be a community rep. I can take
care of the programming and marketing, but I never want my users to feel
like they don&#8217;t have my ear.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started <a href="http://www.illestrhyme.com">IllestRhyme</a>, I had never before managed a web application. Much was similar to enterprise development. Much wasn&#8217;t. One of the things I had no idea about was how to manage production deployment of a web app. I settled on some common Django trickery and Git, and it has worked like a charm.</p>

<p>I knew going in that I would use Git for source control. I wanted a distributed version control system to give me an opportunity to work anywhere git was installed. I didn&#8217;t suspect I would use git for deployment, also.</p>

<p>When the site began, I didn&#8217;t even have a &#8220;deployment&#8221; strategy. There were so few visitors to the site that I could work on it live. Within two weeks, it was clear I couldn&#8217;t be showing users HTML 500 errors as frequently as I had been. I needed to start acting like I was working on a &#8220;real&#8221; project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To acquire users for <a href="http://www.illestrhyme.com">IllestRhyme</a>, a user content driven rap site I started, I ran two ads: one on Reddit and one on Facebook. The results were startling.</p>

<p>According to the data from <a href="http://getclicky.com/66528953">Clicky</a>, the analytics engine I use most, Reddit sent me roughly 170 visitors for a 3 day ad, purchased at $30 per day. Of those visitors, only 5 registered for the site. That gives me a conversion rate of 2.8%, at a cost of $18. I&#8217;m happy to eat the cost up front for new users as they&#8217;re the lifeblood of the site, but $18 is pretty extreme.</p>

<p>After the Reddit ad ran its course, I created a Facebook ad with the same parameters: $30 a day, however many visitors that buys me. In the first 12 hours of the Facebook ad, I received 33 visitors, <em>9 of whom signed up</em>. Now I realize it&#8217;s still a bit early to call the race, but even if I get no more visitors from the Facebook ad, my cost of acquisition was $10, 55% cheaper than for the Reddit ad. If my <em>27% conversion rate</em> keeps up, 170 visitors would net me 46 users, at a cost of only $1.96.</p>

<p>I realize this data isn&#8217;t comprehensive, but it&#8217;s still eye opening. Part of this can be attributed to the more focused targeting I was able to do through Facebook. Facebook let me specify that my ad only be shown to the 7 million or so users who:
1. Live in the US
2. Are 18 or older
3. like #Freestyle rap, #Hip hop music, or #Rapping</p>

<p>Conversely, on Reddit I was forced to choose a subreddit to advertise on (along with a small percentage of the site at large). I chose /r/hiphopheads as it&#8217;s a large (by Reddit standards) and active subreddit.</p>

<p>Regardless of the targeting differences, I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that Facebook users are at least more willing to sign up for websites than are Reddit users. Interestingly, I use the Facebook registration app for my registration form. It&#8217;s not clear from the data (I&#8217;m running an A/B test now), but it appears that Facebook users are more willing to sign up if they are presented with a Facebook form to fill out. For Reddit users, who are more Internet savvy, this may actually be a deterrent.</p>

<p>Of course this doesn&#8217;t take into account what <em>kind</em> of users those who registered will turn out to be. It may be the case that Facebook users are more likely to sign up for something and never use it (although the initial data indicates this isn&#8217;t the case, at least categorically). Those five Reddit users may be the five most active users on IllestRhyme for the next year. For $18 a piece, they better be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I developed <a href="http://www.illestrhyme.com">IllestRhyme</a> using Django, having never touched it before. I chose it because it&#8217;s Python based, and a quick search showed there were a lot of third-party applications available. In two weeks, I had a fully functional site. The site has come a long way since it launched in the beginning of January (looking at the git commit comments is especially fun), but what let me add features so quickly was the third party apps.</p>

<p>First off, some best practices. When I began intalling applications I did so using pip, which downloads packages (by default) from <a href="http://pypi.python.org">PyPi</a>, the Python Package Index. This seemed reasonable, as I wanted stable versions of packages and an easy way to reinstall everything in case of emergency. The packages on PyPi, howevery, usually trail the main branch of a project, sometimes significantly so. So I went back and removed all of the pip-installed packages and checked everything out from source.</p>

<p>I can still rebuild everything in an emergency since (a) my entire site is under source control and (b) setting up a Python dependecies file to download the packages I require was a breeze. Ok, enough meta-discussion. The real question is, &#8220;what applications am I using?&#8221; Here&#8217;s the current list:</p>

<ul>
<li>django.contrib.auth</li>
<li>django.contrib.contenttypes</li>
<li>django.contrib.sessions</li>
<li>django.contrib.sites</li>
<li>django.contrib.messages</li>
<li>django.contrib.staticfiles</li>
<li>django.contrib.sitemaps</li>
<li>south</li>
<li>django.contrib.admin</li>
<li>django.contrib.admindocs</li>
<li>voting</li>
<li>django.contrib.comments</li>
<li>basic.inlines</li>
<li>basic.blog</li>
<li>basic.groups</li>
<li>tagging</li>
<li>django.contrib.markup</li>
<li>pybb</li>
<li>pytils</li>
<li>sorl.thumbnail</li>
<li>pagination</li>
<li>postman</li>
<li>oembed</li>
<li>analytical</li>
<li>basic.tools</li>
</ul>


<p>Those applications gave me, in no particular order: forums, a blog, voting on user defined objects, database migrations, tagging, analytics integration, groups (&#8220;Crews&#8221; on the site) and group membership workflows, and oEmbeded links. Most required minimal setup. More importantly, they allowed me to quickly deliver features that users wanted while being able to focus on the site&#8217;s core features, which were written from scratch.</p>

<p>In addition to being well written, most are very well documented, either via an .rst file on github/bitbucket or, even better, a Sphinx generated page on <a href="http://www.readthedocs.org">ReadTheDocs</a>. And the best part about them is they&#8217;re all open source, so they&#8217;re eminnently moldable if you&#8217;re doing something a little outside the lines. Since you have the source, it&#8217;s trivial to fork the code and change it locally, merging bug fixes from the main branch. This is another reason why using the checked out code is superior to PyPi packages: you get bugfixes and features as soon as they&#8217;re written.</p>

<p>For all of Django&#8217;s plusses, though, there are some minuses. The framework can be rigid at times, forcing you into a particular way of doing things. Often that&#8217;s not an issue, but sometimes you want the framework to just &#8220;get out of your way&#8221; and code closer to the bare metal. Those who are interested in a bit less restrictive frameworks should check out web.py and Pylons. That said, working within the framework (the way it&#8217;s meant to be used) can lead to a huge productivity increase, as so much is taken care of for you. In the end, it&#8217;s just Python code, so you almost always have an &#8220;out&#8221;.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting with Django is how my development process has matured since starting the site, something I&#8217;ll go into in a future post. For now, if you have any Django related questions, feel free to hit me up at <a href="mailto:jknupp@gmail.com">jeff@jeffknupp.com</a>&#8230; Or do what everyone else does and Google until you find a StackOverlow question that matches yours.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So now that I got my &#8220;Hello World&#8221; post out of the way, I think it would be instructive to describe the setup process for this blog. Octopress is exactly what I&#8217;ve been looking for: a well styled, static page based blogging engine that doesn&#8217;t get in my way. The fact that Jekyll (on which Octopress is based) is so closely integrated with git is a definite plus. So how did the install go? First some background.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m the founder of <a href="http://www.illestrhyme.com">IllestRhyme.com</a>, a site where users post rap verses they wrote and other users comment/vote on them. There&#8217;s a ton of other features, but that&#8217;s the gist of it. Anyway, I run IllestRhyme on a <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=ae1808f234f8e219de24842336fada09ef81d52f">Linode</a> server running Ubuntu. I use Apache for dynamic content and Lighttpd for static content. Since I already have a Linux machine on the Interwebs, I followed the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">instructions</a> on my Linode machine&#8230; which is to say I basically copy and pasted the instructions:</p>

<pre><code>rvm install 1.9.2 &amp;&amp; rvm use 1.9.2
git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
cd octopress    # If you use RVM, You'll be asked if you trust the .rvmrc file (say yes).
gem install bundler`
bundle install`
</code></pre>

<p>Everything went smoothly. Next I needed to make Apache serve both www.jeffknupp.com and www.illestrhyme.com. I created a new file in /etc/apache2/sites-available/ named &#8216;jeffknupp.com&#8217; and added the normal VirtualHost settings. After running <code>sudo a2ensite jeffknupp.com</code> and reloading apache (<code>sudo service apache2 reload</code>), Apache helpfully warned me that I didn&#8217;t have NameVirtualHost set and nothing was going to be listening on port 80. After quickly adding <code>NameVirtualHost 50.116.49.236:80</code> to my apache2.conf file, I reloaded again. I pointed my browser to www.jeffknupp.com and&#8230; saw a directory listing of my Octopress install. One quick edit to my jeffknupp.com site configuration and I was good to go. I successfully saw my Hello World post.</p>

<p>So how long did this all take? Maybe 20 minutes, and most of that was installing Ruby. I&#8217;m quite happy with the result: I now have a blogging engine &#8220;for hackers&#8221; that suits my needs perfectly.</p>
