Thought experiment: You and your technical co-founder just finished your MVP and
got some angel investors. You need to further build out your product. For your
next *technical* hire, do you hire a) a sysadmin, b) a DBA, c) a release
engineer, or d) a developer. I can probably count on one hand the number of
startups that have more DBAs than developers. Why? Because, while it's possible
for a developer to do a passable job as a part-time DBA from the moment they're hired,
the reverse is simply not true.


### I never said "Developers are better than everyone else"

Nor did I say they are *more important*, or valuable somehow. I merely said they have higher *utility* than other positions 
(*especially* at startups). Why? On average, a developer can do a passable job of DBA or QA team in a pinch while the reverse is not true. 

That is not to say they will do a *good* job, or that *all* developers are capable of this. 
I'm not speaking anecdotally, as many of the comments do.  I'm saying it's at least possible for a developer to do some of the work of a
DBA or SA. It's clearly *not* possible for a DBA or SA to do the work of the developer. Again, not because a developer's job is too hard or too important,
but because said DBA or SA *doesn't know how to write code* (it's not required for their job). Any competent developer needs to have a 
decent working knowledge of the full stack, so they can probably administer a
machine, if required. This is just an artifact of the requirements for different
roles.

If you still disagree, let me put it another way: how many times have you heard
a start-up founder say, "our technical team is 4 DBAs strong, but we're getting
big enough to hire our first developer soon"? Why aren't DBAs hired before
developers? Because the first technical hires are forced to wear many hats, and
DBAs have very specialized knowledge that doesn't translate well to other roles.
And lest you accuse me of picking on DBAs, this is true of all of the other
positions I mentioned as well.

### I never said "DevOps, as a position (rather than movement), is bad"

Nor did I say DevOps *people* are useless or less important than developers. People hired under the "DevOps" title are typically hybrid
SAs + Release Engineers and are fantastically valuable individuals. "DevOps" *as a movement* is what is hurting 
developers (specifically, companies using it as an excuse *not to hire* qualified professionals for specialized roles); this is 
totally unrelated to people hired to do "DevOps" work.  

### I never said "Developers don't need to have an end-to-end view of how their system works"

Of course they do. There's a big difference, however, between understanding databases and *maintaining* them.
Developers should not be responsible for the latter. Nor should they be
responsible for managing hardware or OS-level software. There are professionals
who do that for a living.

## Common Reactions

### "DevOps is not about developers doing Ops work, it about operations automating tasks like developers do"

Or its close cousin, "You don't know what DevOps is. It's about people working together to improve the product." Note that *I'm not claiming
that DevOps means "developers who do Ops". I'm saying that when *companies* and *management* have adopted that interpretation, everybody loses.

### "Your totem pole example is just plain wrong/offensive"

Perhaps I should have used a less-charged analogy than "totem pole", since
everyone seems to immediately assume "importance" or "competence" is being
discussed when it's involved. I was simply trying to evoke a visual
representation of the hierarchy *of utility*. "Hierarchy" is another word people
went crazy over as soon as it was mentioned. Again, all I'm trying to do is show
which roles can realistically be performed by which other roles.

Specifically, I don't think that developers deserve some special status among
tech employees. Clearly, all roles have an important part to play. It's due to
my failings as a writer that (much to my surprise) some readers thought that was
what I was saying.

### "You must hate your job" or "He must be forced to do Ops work and think he's above it"

Nope. I solely do development at my job. My current employer has a great DevOps
team that are happy to tackle DevOps related tasks. **The article had nothing to
do with my current job**. 
    
It came about as I was wandering around the PyCon job fair, looking at the requirements for various positions. I saw the term
"full-stack developer" often enough to notice it, and tried to determine where this ridiculous notion came from. 
The article was a description of my guess.
