Thought experiment: You and your technical co-founder just finished your MVP and
got some angel investors. You need to further build out your product. For your
next *technical* hire, do you hire a) a sysadmin, b) a DBA, c) a release
engineer, or d) a developer. I can probably count on one hand the number of
startups that have more DBAs than developers. Why? Because, while it's possible
for a developer to do a passable job as a part-time DBA from the moment they're hired,
the reverse is simply not true.

Things I didn't say:

* Developers are better than everyone else, or are *more important* somehow. I
  merely said they have higher *utility* than all other positions because, on
  average, developers can do a passable job of DBA or QA team in a pinch. The
  reverse is not true.
* DevOps, as a position (rather than movement), is useless or less important
  than developers. People hired under the "DevOps" title are typically hybrid
  SAs + Release Engineers and are fantastically valuable individuals. "DevOps" *as a movement* is what is hurting developers;
  this is totally unrelated to people hired to do "DevOps" work.
* Developers don't need to have an end-to-end view of how their system works. Of
  course they do. There's a big difference, however, between understanding a
  system and *maintaining* it.

My response to some common reactions:

### Google and Facebook SREs make more than developers, so that disproves the theory that devs are more important to devops.

There are so many things wrong with this statement I don't know where to start.
First, Google and Facebook are the two most extreme examples of companies that
rely extensively on infrastructure engineers and, thus, are the two absolute
most useless example companies with which to make this point.

Second, I was referring to developers utility *in a start-up*, not in companies
with tens of thousands of employees. That fact that Google and Facebook
have such positions *supports* my argument that these responsiblities should not
be folded into the normal responsibilities of a developer. Google and Facebook
realized that and created separate positions for what is, and should be, a
separate job.

### DevOps is not about developers doing Ops work, it about operations automating tasks like developers do

First, that's most assuredly *not* the original intention of the DevOps movement. The concern was that developers
