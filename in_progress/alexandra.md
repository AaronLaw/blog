There is an activity I enjoy more than any other. My profession is based on it,
as are most of my hobbies. **Creation**. I love to make things that didn't
previously exist. The fact that I can do this at all fascinates me.

Most of my creations are software. They are the result of both planning and 
execution. Oftentimes, my software creations must be explicitly released. Simply
creating is not enough. I must take concrete steps to make my creation
available to the world. In some cases, my creations must be looked after and
managed in some way, requiring ongoing care.

When you're in the creation business, the *release process* for a creation is
important. Especially when the creation will be integrated into existing
systems, ensuring those systems are ready to handle the new creation is vital. A
premature release on unsuspecting systems may have negative consequences.

But as someone who creates, you plan for this. In fact, you plan for everything:
design, execution, release, and ongoing management. Creation and planning are
usually intertwined.

As are creation and **chaos.**

On Thursday, July 25th, the creation of which I am most proud to have been apart
of was released a bit earlier than planned. **Alexandra Grace Knupp**,
originally due August 26th, was born at 7:20 AM, much to the surprise of her
parents. Mother and baby are both doing exceptionally well.

Alexandra's (Alex's) birth served as a reminder for a very important lesson:
life happens. Nothing in life is guaranteed. It always seems as if there
will be more time. For example, I had planned to write a letter to my daughter
before she was born. I was going to tell her all about the funny, interesting (to me), and poignant details 
surrounding her birth and my wife's pregnancy. 

And then life happened.

The fact that you are given a due date gives you a false sense of security.
You are given, by a doctor you trust, an *exact date* on which you should expect
the birth of your child. Sure, most due dates don't turn out to be accurate to the
day, but surely one can expect to be within a few days or, at most, a few weeks
of that date, right?

**Wrong.**

Life has a funny way of disregarding human planning. It's always good to be
reminded of that in situations that don't end badly so you can avoid
experiencing one that does. Of course, it's not possible to never be surprised
by life, but it *is* possible to stop putting of for tomorrow those important
things that can be done today.

In fact, Alex's entire conception was an example of planning for the unexpected.
My wife and I knew we wanted to start a family soon after our marriage in July
of last year but differed on just how soon: she wanted to start immediately
while I wanted to wait for our finances to even-out after the wedding. She
agreed, but after a month I had a change of heart. 

I remembered that nothing in life is certain. We could have had problems conceiving, one of us may have had an unknown condition that would prevent it, it may have taken far longer than we had anticipated, etc.
So, with the proper amount of respect for the unpredicability of life, we began trying to conceive. We were exceptionally lucky to have been able to do so relatively quickly.

I should have kept that in mind when planning for her birth. 

Creation and chaos are intertwined. But life, in general, is chaos. We were
extraordinarily lucky to have made it through the surprising turn of events in
good health and good spirits. We may not always be so lucky, and we can't change
that. But we will redouble our efforts not to put off important things that can 
be done today, regardless of how *certain* we are that there will be more time.
And we will remember that, "the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry."

And plan accordingly.
