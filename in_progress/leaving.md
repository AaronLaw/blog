For those who noticed, I apologize for the radio silence over the past month.
I've been preoccupied with job related activities, which I can discuss at long
last. I've decided to leave my current position (and the finance industry all-together).
This month, I'll be joining [AppNexus](http://www.appnexus.com), a 
recognized leader in the online ad tech space. My role will be centered 
around expanding their "Big Data" platform (infrastructure rather 
than pure data-analysis).

I'm extremely excited about this for a number of reasons. The company is
experiencing explosive growth, the people are smart and passionate, and the work
is incredibly interesting (to me). I'm also looking forward to growing
professionally; I've basically been working on the same thing (between two
companies) since graduating college. I have learned a ton in that time, but the
"learning vs. time" graph has been trending downward for the past few years. I'm
reinvigorated at the notion of working on something completely new (which still
makes use of my experience building high-throughput, low-latency systems).

On another note, I'm happy to be leaving finance. I'll discuss this a bit more
in a few weeks, but for now I'll simply say that financial technology jobs are
quite different than technology positions in almost every other sector. This
change has been long-overdue for me, and I appreciate the opportunity I've been
given.

Anyway, look for my next Python related post (which I've been working on for
some time) to appear in the next few days. Also, for those that subscribe to my
newsletter, the project I discussed with all of you a few weeks ago is gaining
momentum. Look for more news on that front in the coming weeks. And last, but
not least, the next version of [Writing Idiomatic Python](http://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/),
which contains a ton of new content, should be available in the next two weeks.
Lots of stuff to look forward to (for both you and I)!
