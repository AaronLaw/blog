## What Depression Looks Like: A Raw Account

In January of 2011 is was twenty-eight years old and had
just ended a seven year relationship, losing many 
friends in the process. I found myself alone. *Really alone*. 
I had no idea how, at twenty-eight, with almost no friends 
nearby and working in an industry I hated, I would "rebuild" 
my life.

I had no energy. Simply going to work took a hurculean effort. Anything more than 
that was too much. Activites I used to enjoy seemed pointless and not worth
the effort. I wanted to be home in my bed at all times. 

I had no interest in seeing anyone and was convinced no one, aside from my parents,
cared about me. I distinctly remember thinking, on a Friday night in my apartment, that 
if I died at that instant it would be four or five days before anyone found my body.

**I was convinced I would never be happy again**.

In fact, I could not even imagine a future in which I was happy. I felt
worthless. My memory and concentration (which was already problematic due to 
ADHD) were terrible. Despite the tremendous loss of energy, I 
developed terrible insomnia. Frequent headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite: I had them
all. I lost over 40 pounds. I ate one meal a day.

With the fatigue, insomnia, and decreased memory and concentration, a day at work 
was hell. I couldn't bring myself to do the simplest things. Every task seemed
pointless. My productivity dropped precipitously. 

To some, this account of my life in 2011 will be shocking. To others, it
will be painfully familiar. What I experienced was, unfortunately, the effects
of an extremely common condition that is rarely publicly discussed: clinical
depression.

According to the journal *Lancet*, as of 2010, 289 **million** people worldwide 
suffer from depression (4.3% of the population). 17% of individuals in the U.S.
will suffer a major depressive episode. In any single year, a male in North
America has a 3-5% chance of having a depressive episode, while a female 
has an 8-10% chance.

With such a large segment of the population afflicted with this illness (and it
*is* an illness), one would think it would be hot topic in the public discourse. 
It's not.  The stigma associated with depression is powerful and real. 
It keeps sufferers silent. As a country, the U.S. is *scared* of depression.

I've heard a number of opinions about my depression and a number of suggestions for
"curing" it. They all have something in common. Some told me if I only exercised 
more I wouldn't be depressed. Or if I stopped drinking caffiene. Or ate better.
Or slept more. Some thought "depression" meant I was just feeling sad. They didn't understand 
why I didn't just "snap out of it." They assumed I was simply too weak to overcome
this bad patch. 

**In short, a large number of people blamed me for my depression.**

Let me be clear: major depressive disorder (a.k.a clinical depression) is a
**disease**, and it should be discussed as such. No one tells a stroke victim to
just "snap out of it." No one tells a Parkinson's sufferer that if they simply
changed their diet, everything would be fine. No one blames someone
with ALS for their disease or for the continual deterioriation they experience.

Yet depression is commonly viewed as merely being unusually sad, and thus
easily overcome. Anyone who suffers from it must be doing something wrong.
The typical reaction is, "Surely everyone can do things to make themselves happy, no? Why don't 
depression sufferers just stop moping about and go do happy things?"

It's a ridiculous and *harmful* view of a serious and debilitating condition. I'll make a bold statement because the issue is so important:

> Today in the U.S., the social stigma attached to
> depression is greater than the stigma attached to homosexuality[^1]. 

Though there is still quite a way to go, the public attitude regarding 
homosexuality in this country has shifted in the right direction (and in the past 
decade or so has gathered a good deal of momentum). That is not to say that 
the challenges the gay community has historically faced should be ignored. 
Rather, the general public's attitude towards depression is akin to 
that towards homosexuality in the 20's and 30's: it is not discussed
in public; the hardships one faces are handled alone, if at all.

The worst part of depression is that it doesn't fight fair. In addition to
medication and psychotherapy, beating depression takes work. Hard work.
Depression saps one of the very energy required to do that work. It makes the
activities that aid in recovery seem unbearable: socializing with friends, taking
up hobbies or group activities, getting out of the house, etc.
**Depression is like a living organism, protecting itself by defending its weaknesses**. 

As such, it's easy to anthropomorphize depression, imagining it as a human enemy 
hell-bent on destroying sufferers. It's an enemy that fights dirty, kicking you
while you're down. It even recruits other conditions to its side: 51% of
those with major depression will also suffer from anxiety (or already do). 
Anxiety makes recovery more difficult, worsens symptoms, and increases the risk of suicide.

Because that's the endgame for depression. Either one is able to gather enough
resources to beat it, or not. And if depression wins (which is *not* the fault of 
the sufferer), the result is fatal. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death
worldwide.


It slowly grew into a major depressive episode that would end up 
lasting more than six months. 
That was just one part of the overall problem (in my mind). I had
very little self worth, which lead me to believe I didn't have anything
useful to say.
It seemed impossible. I felt as 
though I would never be happy again.

publicly as if it were.
