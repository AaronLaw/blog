There are two recent trends I really hate: DevOps and the notion of the
"full-stack" developer. The DevOps movement is so popular that I may as well say
I hate the x86 archtitecure or monolithic kernels. But it's true: I can't stand
it. The cause my pain boils down to a very simple fact: not every company is a 
startup, though it appears that every company must act as though they were.

"DevOps" is meant to mean a close collaboration and cross-pollination between what were previously purely
development roles, purely operations roles, and purely QA roles. Because
software apparently needs to be released at an ever-increasing rate, the old
"waterfall" develop-test-release cycle is seen as broken. Developers must also
take responsibility for the quality of the testing and release envrionments.

The increasing scope of responsibility of the "developer" (whether or not that term is even
appropriate anymore is debatable) has given rise to a chimera-like job
candidate: the "full-stack" developer. Such a developer is capable of doing the
job of developer, QA team, operations analyst, sysadmin, and DBA. Before you
accuse me of hyperbole, go back and read that list again. Is there any role in
the list whose duties you *wouldn't* expect a "full-stack" developer to be well versed in?

Where did both of these concepts come from? Start-ups, of course (and the Agile
methodology). Start-ups are a peculiar beast and need to function in a very lean
way to survive their first few years. I don't deny this. Unfortunately, we've taken the multiple
technical roles that engineers at start-ups *were forced to play due to lack of resources*
into a set of minimum qualifications for the role of "developer".

Imagine you're at a startup with a development team of seven. You're one year
into development of a web applications that X's all the Y's and things are going
well, though it's always a frantic scramble to keep everything going. If there's
a particularly nasty issue that seems to require deep database knowledge, you
don't have the liberty of saying "that's not my speciality" and handing it off
to a DBA team to investigate. **Due to constrained resources,** you're forced to
take the role of DBA and fix the issue yourself.

Now expand that scenario across all the roles listed earlier. At any
one time, a developer at a start-up may be acting as a developer, QA tester,
deployment/operations analyst, sysadmin, or DBA. That's just the nature of the
business, and some people thrive in that type of environment. Somewhere along
the way, however, we tricked ourselves into thinking that because, at any one
time, a start-up developer *had* to take on different roles he or she *should actually be all those things at once.*

If such people **even existed**, "full-stack" developers *still* wouldn't be used as
they should. Rather than temporarily taking on *a single role* for a short period of time,
then transitioning into the next role, they are meant to be performing **all the roles, all the time**.
And here's what really sucks: most good developers can almost pull this off.

Good developers are smart people. I know I'm going to get a ton of hate
mail, but there *is* a hierarchy of usefulness of technology roles in an
organization. Devloper is at the top, followed by sysadmin and DBA each of
QA teams, "operations", release coordinators and the like are at the bottom 
of the totem pole. Why is it arranged like this? Becuase each role can do the
job of any/all of the roles below it if absolutely neccessary.
