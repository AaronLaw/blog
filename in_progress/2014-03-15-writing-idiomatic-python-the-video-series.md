My book, "Writing Idiomatic Python," has helped thousands of developers write
more readable Python code. That fact blows me away, and I'm quite humbled by it.
In writing the book, I discovered that I love to teach, and became a
professional Python tutor along the way.

But I want even more developers to write great Python code. For many, reading
a book just isn't effective; they need to *see* something to truly understand
it. I thought long and hard about the most accessible way to convey the book's
message.

**I decided a series of instructional videos would be the best way to reach as
many developers as possible.***

The Kickstarter campaign just launched, and I'm hoping to raise enough money to
simply cover the costs of production (including my time, since I won't be able
to tutor as much during production). If you've read and enjoyed the book, I urge
you to consider backing the project. If funding reaches $10,000, the videos will
all be released under the Creative Commons license, free for everyone, forever.

The rewards for those that fund the project are truly unique, ranging from a
free copy of the book all the way to a day-long seminar for you and twenty-five
of your closest friends/coworkers. Also in there are tutoring sessions, a signed
copy of the No Starch Press version of the book, and more. If you're a current
tutoring client, you could contribute to the campaign and save a good deal on
the normal cost of session. If you've been considering Python tutoring, here's a
perfect way to start.

At the end of the day, I do stuff like this because I love to teach. I get
frustrated, though, at how many people I'm able to reach. This project is my
attempt to teach a larger audience the principles that thousands of developers
have already discovered. I hope you'll consider backing my project.
