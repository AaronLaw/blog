# Creating an Open Source Python Library The Right Way

Most developers accumulate a personal library of tools they've written throughout 
their career. They range from little scripts to not so little libraries, but are 
generally things that the developer wrote because (ostensibly) nothing existed 
to solve his or her particular problem. Many of these tools might be useful to
other developers, but they never see the light of day. 

I'd like to make the road to Open-Sourcing Python projects more clear. 
I've released a few open source tools, many of which were Python-based. In doing
so, I've noticed a series of steps common to those projects done in Python. In
the vein of another popular series I've written, "Starting a Django Project The
Right Way," I'll outline the steps I've found to be necessary when creating an
Open Source Python project.

## This Article Will Cover

Successful open source Python projects are more than just code. They have an 
entire ecosystem of tools and services all working together to provide useful
information to both you, your users, and contributors to your project. 
Below is a list of the concepts and technologies we'll be covering in this article:

* Project layout (directory structure)
* [git](http://www.git-scm.com) for version control
* [GitHub](http://www.github.com) for project management
* [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for git workflow
* `virtualenv` for managing project dependencies 
* PyPI, `setuptools`, and the `setup.py` file
* [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) for auto-generated HTML documentation
* [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) for continuous integration testing
* [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org) for automated documentation deployment
* [coverage.io](http://coverage.io) for test coverage continuous integration

*Note: In this article, I'll assume you have an existing code base you're looking to open source (and I'll assume you're using Python 2.7.x, but the steps are largely the same if you're using Python 3.x).*

## Project Layout

When setting up a project, the *layout* (or *directory structure*) is important
to get right. A sensible layout means that potential contributors don't have to
spend forever hunting for a piece of code; file locations are intuitive. Since
we're dealing with an existing project, it means you'll probably need to move
some stuff around.

Let's start at the top. Most projects have a number of top-level files (like
`setup.py`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, etc). There are then three
directories that *every* project should have:

1. A `docs` directory containing project documentation
1. A directory named with the project's name which stores the actual Python package
1. A `test` directory in one of two places
    1. Under the package directory containing test code and resources
    1. As a stand-alone top level directory

To get a better sense of how your files should be organized, here's a simplified snapshot
of the layout for one of my projects, [sandman](http://www.github.com/jeffknupp/sandman):

    #!bash
    $ pwd
    ~/code/sandman
    $ tree
    .
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── TODO.md
    ├── docs
    │   ├── conf.py
    │   ├── generated
    │   ├── index.rst
    │   ├── installation.rst
    │   ├── modules.rst
    │   ├── quickstart.rst
    │   └── sandman.rst
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── sandman
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── exception.py
    │   ├── model.py
    │   ├── sandman.py
    │   └── test
    │       ├── models.py
    │       └── test_sandman.py
    └── setup.py

    4 directories, 17 files

As you can see, there are some top level files, a `docs` directory (`generated`
is an empty directory where sphinx will put the generated documentation), a
`sandman` directory, and a `test` directory under `sandman`.

## Source Control With Git, Project Management with GitHub

In "Starting a Django Project The Right Way," I suggest either git
and mercurial for version control. For a project meant to be both shared and
contributed to, there's really only one choice: git. In fact, I'll go so far as
to say that not only is the use of git necessary, you'll also need to use
[GitHub](http://www.github.com) to maintain your project if you want people to
actually use and contribute to it. 

It's not meant to be an inflamitory statement (though no doubt many will 
take issue with it). Rather, for better or worse, git
and [GitHub](http://www.github.com) have become the de-facto standard for
managing Open Source projects. GitHub is the site potential users and
contributors are most likely to be registered at and most likely to be familiar
with the workflow.

#### A Sensible Git Workflow With Git-Flow

To make things easier on both yourself and contributors, we'll be using the
very popular [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
model of branching. In short, the `develop` branch off of which branches for new features
should be made. Once a feature is complete, the changes are merged back in to
`develop` and the feature branch is deleted. Updating `master` is done through
the creation of a `release`. Install git-flow by following the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation).

Once installed, you can migrate your existing project with the command

    #!bash
    $ git flow init

The default values suggested by git-flow are fine to use.

## `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`

Ian Bicking's `virtualenv` tool has become the de-facto standard mechanism for
isolating Python environments. Its purpose is simple: if you have a number of
Python projects on a single machine, each with different dependencies (perhaps
with dependencies on different versions of the same package), managing the dependencies in a
single Python installation is nigh impossible. 

`virtualenv` creates "virtual" Python installations, each with their 
own, segregated, `site-packages`. `distribute` and `pip` are also 
installed in such a way that `pip install` correctly installs packages 
to the `virtualenv` rather than the system Python installation. Switching back 
and forth between your `virtualenv` is a one-command process.

A separate tool, Doug Hellmann's `virtualenvwrapper`, makes creating and managing multiple 
`virtualenv`s easier. Let's go ahead and install both now:

    #!bash
    $ pip install `virtualenvwrapper`
    ...
    Successfully installed `virtualenvwrapper` `virtualenv` `virtualenv`-clone stevedore
    Cleaning up...

As you can see, the latter has a dependency on the former, so simply installing
`virtualenvwrapper` is sufficient. Note that if you're using Python 
3, [PEP-405](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/), which gives Python 
native support for virtual environments through the `venv` package 
and `pyvenv` command, was implemented in Python 3.3. You should use that instead
of the tools mentioned above.

Once you've installed `virtualenvwrapper`, you'll need to add a line to your
`.zhsrc` file (or `.bashrc` file for bash users):

    #!bash
    $ echo "source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.zshrc

This adds a number of useful commands to your shell (remember to `source` your
`.zshrc` to actually make them available for the first time). While you can create a
`virtualenv` directly with the `mkvirtualenv` command, creating a *"project"*
using `mkproject [OPTIONS] DEST_DIR` is usually more useful. Since we have 
an existing project, however, we'll simply create a new `virtualenv` for our
project. We can do this with a simple command:

    $ mkvirtualenv ossproject

    New python executable in ossproject/bin/python
    Installing setuptools............done.
    Installing pip...............done.
    (ossproject)$ 

You'll notice your shell prompt is now prepended by the name of your `virtualenv`
(which I called "ossproject", but obviously you can use whatever name you'd
like). Now anything installed via `pip install` is installed to the
`site-packages` of your `virtualenv`. 

To stop working on your project and switch back to the system installation, use 
the `deactivate` command. You should see the `virtualenv` name that was prepended 
to your shell prompt dissapear. To resume work on your project, run `$ workon
<project name>` and you'll be back in your `virtualenv`.

Aside from simply creating the `virtualenv` for your project, you'll use it to
do one more thing: generate your `requirements.txt` file. `pip` is capable of
installing all of project's dependencies by using a requirements file and the
`-r` flag. To create this file, run the following command within your `virtualenv`
(once your code is working with the `virtualenv`, that is):

    #!bash
    (ossproject)$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

You'll get a nice list of all of the requirements for your project, which can
later be used by the setup.py file to list your dependencies. One note here: I
often change the '==' to '>=' in `requirements.txt` to say "any version of this
package after the one I'm working on." Whether or not you should/need to do this
is project specific, but I just thought I'd point it out.

Commit `requirements.txt` to your git repo, as a number of tools/services we'll
see later make use of it.

## PyPI and `setuptools`

TODO

## Testing With py.test

In the Python automated testing ecosystem, there are two main alternatives to
the (quite usable) Python standard library `unittest` package:
[nose](http://www.nosetest.org) and [py.test](http://www.pytest.org). Both 
extend `unittest` to make it easier to work with while adding additional
functionality. Truthfully, either is a fine choice. I happen to prefer
`py.test`'s support for using `assert` for testing assertions rather than
relying on remembering all the jUnit-style assert functions. In addition,
there's generally less boilerplate, support for multiple styles of test
(`unittest`, `doctest`, and even nose tests), and support for testing
setuptools/distutils projects (i.e. `python setup.py test`).

#### Note

If you already have an automated testing solution, feel free to continue using
it and skip this section. Be warned that later sections may assume testing is
done using py.test, which may affect configuration values.

In the `test` directory under your main package, create a file called
`test_<project_name>.py`. py.test's test discovery mechanism will treat any file
with the `test_` prefix as a test file (unless told otherwise).

What you put in that file is largely up to you. Writing tests is a giant topic 
and outside of the scope of this article. The important thing, however, is that the
tests are useful to both you *and potential contributors*. It should be clear
what functionality each test is exercising. Tests should be written in the same
"style" so that a potential contributor doesn't have to guess which of the three
styles of testing used in your project he/she should use.

The main goal is for the tests to be easy to run. There should be a single
command to run "all" of the tests. If you need to test against multiple
interpreters, consider using [tox](http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

#### Test Coverage

Automated test coverage is a contentious topic. Some believe it to be a
meaningless number that gives false security. Others find it genuinely useful.
At the very least, I would suggest if you already have tests and have *never*
checked your test coverage, do so now as an exercise.
